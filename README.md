## Features

*   **Extensive Rule Customization**: Break free from traditional gameplay with dozens of optional rules. Enable settings like "Piece Stacking," "Pawn Promotion," "Flying Generals," and many more.
*   **LAN Multiplayer**: Challenge a friend over your local network. The game supports hosting and joining LAN games with real-time synchronization of moves and rule changes.
*   **Rule-Based Engine**: The game is built on a flexible, rule-based engine that allows for easy addition of new, creative gameplay variations.
*   **Save & Load Games**: Export your current game state, including all custom rules and board positions, to a JSON file. Import them later to resume your game or share interesting scenarios.
*   **Intuitive UI**: A clean and straightforward interface that includes a move history panel, a dynamic rule settings panel, and real-time game status updates.
*   **Force Move**: A unique feature allowing players to suggest and (if agreed upon) execute moves that may not be traditionally valid, adding another layer of strategic depth.
*   **Developer-Friendly**: Designed with extensibility in mind. Adding new rules is a streamlined process. See [How to Create New Rules](docs/如何创建新玩法(2.X.X).md) for a guide.
